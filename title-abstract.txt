Title:
Human Brain Connectivity using Resting State fMRI Data: Classification of Sex with Graph Neural Networks

Abstract:
In our project, we developed classification models to discern gender difference from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the applicability of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) on resting state fMRI. By exploring brain network differences and use of data simulation with controllable parameters, we constructed a neural network classifier utilizing graph structure alongside a simple baseline model. The results show the two classes are separable when only comparing fMRI resting state data. Our research will walk through steps of statistical methods, simulation, and model description to accomplish our objective.
